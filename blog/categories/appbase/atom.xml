    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi and welcome to the first post on my new blog! I finally got around to setting up octopress and so far I have been very much impressed.</p>

<p>I decided to migrate to octopress, because running a wordpress blog started to become more work and time that I was able to sacrifice. It wasn&rsquo;t the writing of posts, but more the trying to optimize the speed and reducing 500 errors on the small VPS I was using. MySql tuning and php object caching all this and for what?</p>

<p>Octopress solves all this, it&rsquo;s static so no need to run a resource heavy database, moreover you don&rsquo;t even have to manage your own server because I will be running this on someone else&rsquo;s server all this for free! You just can&rsquo;t beat that!</p>

<p>Using octopress you can host your blog on GitHub or Heroku both which I use and have free accounts for. So all in all a big win! Stay tuned for more about technology, development and all things me.</p>
