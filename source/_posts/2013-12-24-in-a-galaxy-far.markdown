Hi and welcome to the first post on my new blog! I finally got around to setting up octopress and so far I have been very much impressed. 

I decided to migrate to octopress, because running a wordpress blog started to become more work and time that I was able to sacrifice. It wasn't the writing of posts, but more the trying to optimize the speed and reducing 500 errors on the small VPS I was using. MySql tuning and php object caching all this and for what? 

Octopress solves all this, it's static so no need to run a resource heavy database, moreover you don't even have to manage your own server because I will be running this on someone else's server all this for free! You just can't beat that! 

Using octopress you can host your blog on GitHub or Heroku both which I use and have free accounts for. So all in all a big win! Stay tuned for more about technology, development and all things me.
